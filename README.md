## FAQ

#### What libraries are you using?

This project uses several JavaScript libraries for better interactivity and visuals: GSAP for animations, AOS for scroll effects, Font Awesome for icons, lightbox for images

#### What framework did you use?

I am using SCSS for styling as part of my learning process to understand how to use SCSS properly. By applying SCSS in a real scenario, I aim to improve the structure and maintainability of my stylesheets, while gaining a deeper understanding of how SCSS enhances standard CSS.
